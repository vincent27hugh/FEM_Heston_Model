# Heston model 

## 2D European Call

* Directly run the file `main_Call.m`. One mesh plot and solution of European price will be generated. Adjust the parameter in `main_Call.m`;
* `Solve.m` and `plot_option.m` files are two function;
* Waiting bars will show the phase of accomplishment of program;
* When programs are done, a alerting sound will ring;


## 2D European Put

* Directly run the file `main_Put.m`. One mesh plot and solution of European price will be generated.Adjust the parameter in `main_Put.m`;
* Waiting bars will show the phase of accomplishment of program;
* When programs are done, an alerting sound will ring;


## Mesh and Basis

* Please directly run file `mesh.m` to get the mesh of spatial resolution of (5,6) with label of triangles and nodes;
* Run file `reference_tri_plot.m` to get the plots of three reference triangles with labels;

**Note**: This is the code for the final project of MA6621, CityU.
